    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The Dry Oar river is one of the cleanest rivers and one with the most crystal-like waters
        ; it is conveniently located at the coast and surrounded by forests.

        A rafting trip in the Dry Oar river is one of the best experiences that you may enjoy during 
        your vacation and it is recommended even for families and/or rafting beginners, as its waters are 
        classified as types II and III, so it gives you the pleasure of a perfect combination of excitement
         and safety.
        
        The river has very calm sections in between rafting areas, so this will enable you to appreciate 
        the beauty of its banks, especially its wildlife, as you will see a great variety of tropical birds,
        such as tick birds, toucans, tiger birds, parrots, parakeets, and other exotic birds. In the middle
        of our journey, we will stop to walk to a waterfall where we will taste delicious season fruits 
        or simply swim and feel the water falling against our back. We will follow the tour for approximately
        two more hours, depending on the water level of the river.</p>
