    <h3>Safety Rules</h3>
    <p>
      A responsible adult mut supervise the inflatable at all times. Do not allow children to enter the inflatable
      without 100% constant adult supervision.
      All riders must remove shoes, jewelry, eyeglasses, combs, hair clips, or any other sharp or hard objects that may
      cause injury to children or the inflatable prior to entering any inflatable. (dry rentals, best if kids wear socks
      for sanitary reasons)
      No silly string or confetti
      No hanging on the water hose, safety nets, or basketball rims. Damage repair costs will range from $80 to $225.
      Max 6-8 kids at a time on any inflatable
      Max 3 kids or one adult at the top of slides at a time absolutely no food, drink, gum, candy, or silly string
      inside inflatable
      No flips, wrestling, running, pushing, climbing nets or walls, or any other aggressive behavior that could injure
      another child. Do not let riders bounce against the side netting, sides, or entrance of inflatable.
      No jumping off the top of slides
      The slide landing area should be clear before the next child goes down the slide.
      Only children of comparable age and size should use the inflatable at the same time. Mixing children of different
      sizes will greatly increase the risk of injury.
      It is not recommended for children to sit or lay down while other children are bouncing around them, as a jumping
      child could fall on top of a sitting or lying child causing injury.
      Water added to dry units will result in a cost from $50 to $100, according to the size of the unit.
      If the blower motor stops: have the children calmly exit the inflatable. Most often, the cause is an overloaded
      circuit or a piece of debris in front of the blower intake. Reset the circuit breaker and make sure the blower is
      plugged into a dedicated circuit. Clear any debris away from the intake on the blower.
      Failure to use good judgment and to follow these safety rules can result in serious injury. The operator must
      always ensure the inflatable is properly staked and/or weighted down & supervised by an adult insuring all safety
      rules are followed accordingly. Also, damage caused by the renterâ€™s negligence to any of the rules can result in a
      cost up to the value of the unit.

    <h3>Game ideas</h3>
    <p>
      Bounce Like a... Game
      Tell the children that every time you count 1-2-3 and then yell out an animal, they have to jump like that animal.
      Try frog, kangaroo, or rabbit, then see what happens when you call out a lizard, bird, elephant, fish, or snail!!
      The Giggle Game
      Have one child lie down in one corner of the inflatable, then have the next child lie down at right angles to the
      first child with his/her head on the first child's stomach. Have a third child lay down with his/her head on the
      second child's stomach. Keep on until everyone is lying down. Then have the first child say "HA." This will cause
      the second child to start laughing, then the third, then so on.
      You may have played this one before, but not in a moonwalk!
      Tumble races
      Have the children take turns with this one.
      Line up four children on one side of the inflatable and when you say "GO," they somersault their way to the other
      side, touch the wall (or net) and then lay down and roll back to the other side.
      Red Light/Green Light
      When you yell "green light," everyone bounces.
      When you yell "red light," everyone freezes.
