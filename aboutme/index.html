    <p>Hello! My name is Howard Pereira, I am from Costa Rica. Im starting this BYU program. 
        Im an electrical engineer trying to expand my knowlegde and also seeking for better job oportunities. Ive been working for medical insdustries for the past 10 years. I have
    been member of the church since I was born and I had the opportunity to serve a mission on 2009 in Ecuador.  </p>
    <p2>I married my wife in 2019 and sice that im the father of two beautiful kids. I like to spend time with them playing and also I like to lear from their behaviour.
        I love to play and watch football, I can spend a whole day waching maches from around the world. Im very happy to have this opportunity to learn how to program, I decided 
    years ago to study another thing, but finally I can invest time on what I some day dreamed to study. </p2>
